# Data_Science_Project_Loans_Default_Prediction

This is a Data Science Pos Degree Project.

## Project Context
Lending Club is an American peer-to-peer lending company, which provides an online platform that
connects borrowers and investors. By cutting out the traditional banking protocol, it aims to provide
loans at a lower interest rate. However, the risk of borrowers defaulting (i.e., being charged off) on
loans is an ever-present concern, as is the need to better understand their customer base for
optimized loan offering and risk mitigation.

## Project data
For this project i have access to an extract the dataset and a data dictionary to help me understand the column titles.
During this development i needed clean the data including dealing with null values, different data types, categorical variables, feature engineering and outliers.

## Project Task
  - Task 1 Classification Model to Predict 'Charged Off'

  By predicting which loans are likely to be charged off, Lending Club can take preventive action, thereby reducing losses and improving their service to both borrowers and investors.
    
  **A.** Build the overall “best” classification model to predict if a loan will be charged off. You will need to decide how you define and demonstrate which model is “best”. Comment on any limitations this model might have when used by           management for its desired purpose. Important you will mostly be graded on your ability to apply the machine learning approaches we have learned in class properly. So please include the work that you test and not just the final best model.
  
  **B.** Determine which features are the most important for detecting loans that will be “charged off”. Discuss if these make sense.
  
  **C.** Assume that Lending Club has a preference to identify loans that will be “charged off” within reason. How can you increase the ability of the classifier to do this? What is the best classifier you can find to achieve this goal. 
     How does it compare to the classifier for part A.
    
  - Task 2 Customer Segmentation
    
  Understanding the diverse needs and behaviours of customers is crucial for targeted marketing, risk assessment, and product development. Customer segmentation can lead to more personalized loan products and better customer satisfaction.

   **A.** Apply different approaches to unsupervised learning to determine different customer segments. You will need to decide how many segments to split the data into and demonstrate how you made this decision. You will need to decide 
       which features make sense for segmenting your data. Comment on any limitations this model might have when used by management for its desired purpose. Important you will mostly be graded on your ability to apply the machine 
       learning approaches we have learned in class properly. So please include the work that you test and not just the final best model.
       
   **B.** See if you can see any pattern in the different segments, if you had to explain the segments to management what would you name each one.
   
   **C.** If you add customer segment as a feature to your model of task 1, does it improve the model? Explain if you think this is a good idea or not.
